# Backend Application

This project is a Node.js backend application built with Express.js, designed to provide a RESTful API for managing news articles. It interacts with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve article data.

## Description

The backend serves as the data and logic layer for the news article management system. It exposes a set of API endpoints that allow the frontend application (or any other client) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on news articles. Key functionalities include:

*   **News Article Management:** Endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting news articles.
*   **Database Integration:** Seamless integration with MongoDB using Mongoose for object data modeling.
*   **API Versioning:** Organized API endpoints under `/api/v1` for better management and future scalability.
*   **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling to provide consistent and informative error responses.
*   **Logging:** Comprehensive logging for requests and application events using Winston and Morgan.
*   **Security:** Basic security measures implemented using Helmet and CORS.

## Essential Libraries

This project utilizes a robust set of Node.js libraries and tools to ensure efficient and secure API operations:

*   **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building the RESTful API.
*   **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It simplifies interactions with the MongoDB database.
*   **Dotenv:** A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, crucial for managing configuration securely.
*   **CORS:** A Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with various options.
*   **Helmet:** Helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers, protecting against common web vulnerabilities.
*   **Winston:** A versatile logging library for Node.js, used for structured and customizable logging of application events and errors.
*   **Morgan:** An HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js, used for logging incoming requests and their details.
*   **Nodemon:** A utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server, greatly enhancing the development workflow.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It significantly improves code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity by enabling static type checking.
*   **Zod:** A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, used for defining and validating data structures.

## How to Start the Backend Application

To get the backend application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change your current directory to the `backend` folder within the project:
    ```bash
    cd packages/backend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the necessary project dependencies. This project uses `bun` as the package manager, but `npm` or `yarn` can also be used.
    ```bash
    bun install
    # or
    # npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables, such as your MongoDB connection string. A typical `.env.local` file might look like this:
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/news_db
    ```
    Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible.

4.  **Start the Development Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, you can start the development server:
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    # or
    # npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    This will start the Express.js server, typically listening on the port specified in your `.env.local` file (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`). The server will automatically restart if you make any code changes.

5.  **Seed the Database (Optional):**
    If you want to populate your database with some initial data for testing or development, you can run the seeding script:
    ```bash
    bun run seed
    # or
    # npm run seed
    # or
    # yarn seed
    ```
    This will add sample news articles to your MongoDB database.

Your backend API is now running and ready to serve requests from the frontend application or other clients.
