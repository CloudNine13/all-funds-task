# Frontend Application

This project is a single-page React application designed to showcase frontend development skills.

## Description

The application displays a list of articles retrieved from a MongoDB database. It features two main views:

*   **Articles:** This tab shows a list of active articles.
*   **Archived:** This tab displays articles that have been archived.

The core functionality allows users to archive an article from the "Articles" tab, which will then move it to the "Archived" tab. Conversely, users can unarchive an article from the "Archived" tab, moving it back to the "Articles" tab.
